# MongoDB File Storage Migration

## Overview
This migration moves all file storage from the local file system to MongoDB using base64 encoding. This solves the ephemeral file system issues in cloud deployments like Render.

## Changes Made

### 1. Portfolio Model Updates (`model/Portfolio.js`)
- Added `profileImageData`, `profileImageType` fields for profile images
- Added `resumeData`, `resumeType` fields for resume files
- Added `imageData`, `imageType` fields for project images
- Added `imageData`, `imageType` fields for certification images

### 2. Upload Routes Overhaul (`routes/upload.js`)
- **Removed**: File system storage using `multer.diskStorage()`
- **Added**: Memory storage using `multer.memoryStorage()`
- **New Approach**: Files are converted to base64 data URLs and stored directly in MongoDB
- **Profile Images**: Stored in portfolio document with base64 data
- **Resume Files**: Stored in portfolio document with base64 data
- **Project Images**: Returned as base64 data URLs for immediate use
- **Certificate Images**: Returned as base64 data URLs for immediate use

### 3. API URL Fixes (`client/src/containers/WorkingBuilder.js`)
- **Fixed**: Hardcoded localhost URLs in publish and save functions
- **Added**: Dynamic API URL detection for production deployments
- **Resolved**: "Network error. Please try again." issue when publishing

### 4. Static File Serving Removal (`index.js`)
- **Removed**: Express static file serving for uploads directory
- **Reason**: Files are now stored as data URLs, no file system needed

### 5. URL Conversion Updates
- **Updated**: URL conversion functions to handle base64 data URLs
- **Maintained**: Backward compatibility for existing URL-based data

## Benefits

### ✅ **Solved Issues**
1. **No more ephemeral file system problems** - Files persist across deployments
2. **No localhost URL issues** - Files are stored as data URLs
3. **Simplified deployment** - No file system dependencies
4. **Better data consistency** - All data in one MongoDB database
5. **Fixed publish network errors** - Correct API URLs in production

### ✅ **Technical Advantages**
- **Platform Independent**: Works on any hosting service
- **No File Persistence Issues**: Files stored in database, not file system
- **Atomic Operations**: File and metadata saved together
- **Backup Friendly**: Files included in database backups
- **Scalable**: No shared file system needed for multiple instances

## File Storage Format

### Before (File System)
```
uploads/
├── profileImage-1754440716234-805116029.png
├── resume-1754440716272-51088086.pdf
└── projectImage-1754440716288-915026565.png
```

### After (MongoDB)
```javascript
{
  profileImage: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...",
  profileImageData: "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...",
  profileImageType: "image/png",
  resume: "data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJcOkw7zDtsO8...",
  resumeData: "JVBERi0xLjQKJcOkw7zDtsO8...",
  resumeType: "application/pdf"
}
```

## API Changes

### Upload Endpoints
- **Input**: Same (multipart/form-data)
- **Output**: Base64 data URLs instead of file URLs
- **Storage**: MongoDB instead of file system

### Portfolio Endpoints
- **Save**: Now handles base64 data seamlessly
- **Publish**: Works with data URLs, no URL conversion needed
- **View**: Serves base64 data directly in HTML

## Testing

### Test Endpoint
- **URL**: `/api/test-data-storage`
- **Purpose**: Verify new storage system is working
- **Response**: Shows sample base64 data format

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- Old file URLs will still work through backward compatibility
- New uploads will use base64 storage
- Migration endpoint available for bulk updates

### File Size Limits
- Increased to 10MB to accommodate base64 encoding overhead
- Base64 encoding increases size by ~33%

## Deployment Impact

### Before
- ❌ Files lost on container restart
- ❌ Localhost URLs in production
- ❌ File system dependencies
- ❌ Complex deployment setup

### After
- ✅ Files persist across deployments
- ✅ No URL issues
- ✅ Database-only storage
- ✅ Simple deployment

This migration ensures that all user data, including files, is stored securely and persistently in MongoDB, eliminating all file system related issues in production deployments.
